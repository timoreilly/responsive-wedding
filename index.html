                        <h1>Why New York?</h1>

			When we began thinking about where to have the wedding, California seemed like the obvious choice. After all, we live there, as do many of our friends and our closest family. But, we realized, much of our extended family is on the East Coast. One day, when we were visiting Jen's mom, who lives in New York City in the home where Jen grew up, just north of The Cloisters, we went out for a walk in Fort Tryon Park, and suddenly it all came together in our minds. What a magnificent location! 
<p>
The Cloisters, in the heart of the park, is a New York City landmark and branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art perched at the highest point on the island of Manhattan.  The Cloisters incorporates parts from five European abbeys which were disassembled and shipped to New York City in the 1930s and contains over 5000 Medieval works of art, including the famous unicorn tapestries.  The building is surrounded with gardens planted according to horticultural information obtained from medieval manuscripts and artifacts. Nearby there is an open plaza with views of the George Washington Bridge, which is often used for wedding ceremonies (and which will be used for ours!), and a block from the house where Jen grew up, the only waterfront restaurant in New York, La Marina, with a magnificent sunset view of the George Washington Bridge, and plenty of space for a fantastic party. (Since its recent refurbishment, it has become one of the hottest night spots in New York, and we will have it all to ourselves.) So there are all the great physical elements for a great wedding location.
</p>
<p>
But the biggest reason we thought of New York was that we'd love this wedding to be a kind of gathering of the tribes. Most of our extended family and many friends live within driving distance of New York. Most of Tim's brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, are in Virginia or Chicago; Jen's parents live in New York, and her extended family hails from Oklahoma and Texas.  We even hope that we can entice down Tim's cousins from Canada - the Balkas to meet the Pahlkas. And we are hopeful that friends and family from California will look at a long weekend in New York as a wonderful spring holiday!</p>

                                From anywhere in Manhattan, take the A train north to 190th Street, <a href="http://untappedcities.com/2013/06/26/deepest-highest-subway-stations-nyc/" target="_blank">the second deepest subway station in New York.</a> Exit via the elevator to Fort Washington Avenue and Margaret Corbin Drive. (Do NOT take the downward-sloping corridor out to Bennett Avenue or you will be very far from where you want to be.) Once you exit the station, walk north into Fort Tryon Park along the Stan Michels Promenade, through the heather gardens, to Linden Terrace, where the ceremony will take place (weather permitting). From the subway station to Linden Terrace is about the equivalent of one long city block.<br />
<p>
                                Bus: The M4 goes straight up Fort Washington Avenue to the Cloisters. This might be a good option if you're already in Washington Heights, but taking the bus from further south in Manhattan would take a long time. Subway is faster.

                                From Manhattan/points south: Take the Henry Hudson Parkway northbound to the Fort Tryon Park/The Cloisters exit, the first exit after the George Washington Bridge. (Please note: this exit is only accessible heading northbound.) Follow the road around to The Cloisters, and park in the free city parking for visitors to The Cloisters. <br />
<p>
                                From from the Bronx/points north: Take the Henry Hudson Parkway southbound to exit 14-15. Immediately follow signs to Henry Hudson Parkway northbound. Travel north on the Henry Hudson Parkway for one mile to the Fort Tryon Park/The Cloisters exit. Follow the road around to The Cloisters, and park in the free city parking for visitors to The Cloisters. Or if the weather is nice, park in the garage at the corner of Dyckman Street and Payson Avenue, so that your car is in easy walking distance of the party.<br />

                            <p>
                                Many New Yorkers have never really explored upper Manhattan, but it is well worth the short trip uptown. Inwood, the area where Jen grew up, has become a vibrant area with many restaurants and nightclubs, but the greatest attractions are outdoors. Inwood Hill Park, directly opposite Jen's mother's house, is the last "wilderness" on the island of Manhattan, a sprawling 196 acre park with running and walking trails, and a great view of the New Jersey Palisades. Just to the south is Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters. The Hudson Greenway allows you to walk along the river all the way down to the George Washington Bridge.

                            <h2>The Cloisters</h2>
                            <p>
                              The 66.5-acre Fort Tryon Park was created by the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. beginning in 1917, when he purchased the Billings Estate and other properties in the Fort Washington area and hired Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., son of one of the designers of Central Park, and the Olmsted Brothers firm to create a park, which he then donated to New York City in 1935. As part of the overall project, Rockefeller also bought the extensive medieval art collection of George Grey Barnard, an American sculptor and collector, who had already established a medieval-art museum near his home in Fort Washington, and gave it to the Metropolitan along with a number of pieces from Rockefeller's own collection, including the Unicorn Tapestries. These became the core of the collection now housed at the Cloisters.<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Tapestry_by_unknown_weaver_-_The_Unicorn_in_Captivity_-_WGA24176.jpg/181px-Tapestry_by_unknown_weaver_-_The_Unicorn_in_Captivity_-_WGA24176.jpg" align="right"></a>
</p><p>
The museum and adjacent gardens within Fort Tryon Park, which incorporate 4 acres, were created through grants and endowments from Rockefeller, and were built from 1934-39. Rockefeller also bought and donated several hundred acres of the New Jersey Palisades to the State of New Jersey on the other side of the Hudson River to preserve the view for the museum. This land is now part of the Palisades Interstate Park.
</p><p>
The museum was designed by Charles Collens who incorporated parts from five cloistered abbeys of Catalan, Occitan and French origins. Buildings from Sant Miquel de Cuixà, Sant Guilhèm dau Desèrt, Bonnefont-en-Comminges, Trie-en-Bigòrra, and Froville were disassembled stone-by-stone and shipped to New York City, where they were reconstructed and integrated by Collens into a cohesive whole by simplifying and merging the various medieval styles in his new buildings.

                            </p>
<h2>Fort Tryon Park</h2>
The Park is situated on a 67 acres ridge in Upper Manhattan, with a commanding view of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge, the New Jersey Palisades and the Harlem River. Once known by the name "Chquaesgeck" by local Lenape Indians, it was called Lange Bergh (Long Hill) by Dutch settlers until the 17th century.
</p><p>
The park was an ancillary site of the American Revolutionary War Battle of Fort Washington, fought on November 16, 1776, between 2,900 American soldiers and 8,000 invading Hessian troops hired by Great Britain. Margaret Corbin became the first woman to fight in the war and was wounded during the battle. Subsequently, the southern entrance to the park bears her name. After the British victory, the outpost was named after Sir William Tryon, the last British Governor of the Province of New York.
</p><p>
<img src="http://www.hudsonvalleyharpist.com/300%20IMG_0305.jpg" align="left" width="35%">
As New York City expanded and prospered, the area was part of a country estate whose wealthy owners, included Dr. Samuel Watkins, founder of Watkins Glen, General Daniel Butterfield, Boss Tweed and C.K.G. Billings. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. purchased the Billings estate in 1917. He hired the Olmsted Brothers firm – and in particular Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., son of the designer of Central Park – to plan a park that he would give to the city. Olmsted's design capitalized on the topography to reveal sweeping vistas of the Hudson River and the Palisades. 
</p><p>
The park's design included extensive plantings of various flora in the park's many gardens, including a Heather Garden, which was restored in the 1980s; the park's plantings were designed by James W. Dawson. Besides the gardens and the Cloisters, the park has extensive walking paths and meadows, with views of the Hudson and Harlem Rivers.

                            <h2>La Marina</h2>
<p>
<img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/d7iaxU5unpg/maxresdefault.jpg" width="30%" align=right >
Dyckman Marina has been a part of upper Manhattan’s unique waterfront culture for more than two centuries. In former times, notable Manhattanites kept their summer estates and yachts here, and seaplanes and ferries dotted the piers. When Jen was growing up, the site was a run-down waterfront where drug dealers plied their trade. Now, nestled just below the Cloisters at the end of Dyckman Street along the Hudson River, sits the new La Marina.The newly rebuilt restaurant, bar, lounge and events space covers more than 75,000 square feet of Hudson River waterfront in Upper Manhattan.</p>
